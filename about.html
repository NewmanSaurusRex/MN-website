              As a human with ADHD, I was egregiously let down by traditional
              school, so I became a teacher to "make it right". I believed that
              if I could work within a detrimental system, that I could be an
              agent of change, offering support to students in the way that was
              so desperately missing from my own experience. I spent 11 years
              crafting a learner-centric, evidence-oriented classroom that
              maintained individual strengths while elevating challenges. üßëüèª‚Äçüè´

            <p class="mb-3 p-3 text-justify">
              My classroom was a collaborative, learning machine! But learning
              never once took precedence over building a trusting, kind and
              equitable environment. Unfortunately, teaching during the Covid-19
              pandemic highlighted layers of inequity that I could no longer
              ignore. I found that there was little space for me to grow as a
              learner and achieve in the ways that I had originally hoped. So,
              in an act of bravery, I left teaching to pursue front-end
              development. üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

              Coding gave me hope at a really low point in my life. To say this
              pandemic has been hard on our family is a gross understatement; my
              spouse is immunocompromised and has been undergoing treatment for
              an undiagnosable immune condition since 2020 ‚Äì you can see the
              added challenges that classroom teaching heaped on here. My career
              change gives my family a better chance at a future.My ADHD often
              manifests as a struggle to "get started‚Äù. Learning to code opened

              For the first time in my life, I feel EXCITED about ENGAGING with
              tasks! Working my way through the challenges writing code presents
              feels enticing and I feel successful because I can create
              something tangible. I hope to work for folks whose mission and
              values are closely aligned with my own commitment to growing
              inclusivity; a place that builds products that strive to offer
              access to an equitable and engaging user experience, in a way that
              works for the folks navigating it! üòé

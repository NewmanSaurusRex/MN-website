              I believe empathy is the best strategy when it comes to solving

              When I'm not pushing pixels you'll likely find me illustrating

            <p>
              As a human with ADHD, I was egregiously let down by traditional
              school, so I became a teacher to "make it right". I believed that
              if I could work within a detrimental system, that I could be an
              agent of change, offering support to students in the way that was
              so desperately missing from my own experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent 11 years crafting a learner-centric, evidence-oriented
              classroom that maintained individual strengths while elevating
              challenges. üßëüèª‚Äçüè´

          <div class="my-story-acts pt-4 col">
            <h4 class="mb-2 text-center">Act II:</h4>
            <p>
              My classroom was a collaborative, learning machine! But learning
              never once took precedence over building a trusting, kind and
              equitable environment. Unfortunately, teaching during the Covid-19
              pandemic highlighted layers of inequity that I could no longer
              ignore.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found that there was little space for me to grow as a learner
              and achieve in the ways that I had originally hoped. So, in an act
              of bravery, I left teaching to pursue front-end development. üßëüèª‚Äçüíª

            <h4 class="mb-2 text-center">Act III:</h4>
            <p>
              My ADHD often manifests as a struggle to "get started‚Äù. Learning
              to code opened my world! Coding gave me hope at a really low point
              in my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              To say this pandemic has been hard on our family is a gross
              understatement; my spouse is immunocompromised and has been
              undergoing treatment for an undiagnosable immune condition since
              2020 ‚Äì you can see the challenges that classroom teaching heaped
              on here. My career change gives my family a better chance at a
              future. üõ∏

              For the first time in my life, I feel EXCITED about ENGAGING with
              tasks! Working my way through the challenges writing code presents
              feels enticing and I feel successful because I can create
              something tangible.

              I hope to work for folks whose mission and values are closely
              aligned with my own commitment to growing inclusivity; a place
              that builds products that strive to offer access to an equitable
              and engaging user experience, in a way that works for the folks
              navigating it! üòé

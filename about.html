    <h1>about M</h1>
    <h2>
      Hey there! I'm M Newman, a Front-end Developer, Educator and Problem
      Solver based in Los Angeles.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I believe empathy is the best strategy when it comes to solving problems.
      I aspire to build products that increase access, equity and justice for
      folks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Act I: As a human with ADHD, I was egregiously let down by traditional
      school, so I became a teacher to "make it right". I believed that if I
      could work within a detrimental system, that I could be an agent of
      change, offering support to students in the way that was so desperately
      missing from my own experience. I spent 11 years crafting a
      learner-centric, evidence-oriented classroom that maintained individual
      strengths while elevating challenges. My classroom was a collaborative,
      learning machine! But learning never once took precedence over building a
      trusting, kind and equitable environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Act II: Unfortunately, teaching during the Covid-19 pandemic highlighted
      layers of inequity that I could no longer ignore. I found that there was
      little space for me to grow as a learner and achieve in the ways that I
      had originally hoped. So, in an act of bravery, I left teaching to pursue
      front-end development üõ∏. Coding gave me hope at a really low point in my
      life. To say this pandemic has been hard on our family is a gross
      understatement; my spouse is immunocompromised and has been undergoing
      treatment for an undiagnosable immune condition since 2020 ‚Äì you can see
      the added challenges that classroom teaching heaped on here. My career
      change gives my family a better chance at a future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Act III: My ADHD often manifests as a struggle to "get started‚Äù. Learning
      to code opened my world! For the first time in my life, I feel EXCITED
      about ENGAGING with something that is in front of me! Working my way
      through the challenges writing code presents feels enticing and I feel
      successful because I can create something tangible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grand Finale: I hope to work for a company whose mission and values are closely aligned
      with my own commitment to growing inclusivity; a place that builds
      products that strive to offer access to an equitable and engaging user
      experience, in a way that works for the folks navigating it!
